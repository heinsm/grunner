Controls
========

The game can be controlled with the keyboard or a joystick/gamepad (this
can be configured in the game menu if a joystick is present).

Character movement:

  Keyboard: use the arrows for direction, 'z' for fire/select.
  Joystick: use first button for fire/select (usually 1 or A).

I think the game controls are pretty straightforward, but just in case:

 - In the stage selection: use left/right and action to select.
 - Cracking a terminal: walk towards the terminal, when cracking has
   started, use left/right to choose the target. Moving down cancels the
   cracking process.

The cracking targets are:

 - Access: will open nearby doors.
 - Lasers: will disable nearby lasers.
 - Link: will recover your link (health).
 - Firewall: will give you extra grid scan (time).

Other controls:

'esc'     skip screen, go back, abort mission.
'p'       pause the game.

The game will try to save your progress in "savegame.dat".


Requirements
============

The game requires OpenGL 2.0+ and at least 960x720 (windowed mode).
